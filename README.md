A virtual horse racing game. My goal was to create a unique set of horses, each with its own probability of winning the race. The horses can then be raced as many times as wished, with each race being completely independent from each other. Every horse has its own name and color. Additonally, I want it so a new set of horses can be summoned with the click of a button.

The races are fast paced, often close, and have frequent lead changes. You can either follow the horses themselves or a dynamic scoreboard. The horse who wins the race will be put onto the top layer of the screen, visible and proud. The game features animated horses and sound effects such as a crowd and inaudible announcer. 

For the future I want to allow the user to place different kinds of bets on the horses and get paid out accordingly.
