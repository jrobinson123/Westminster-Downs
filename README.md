# Westminster-Downs
This is my virtual horse racing game. It shows the fictional race track "Westminster Downs" where 8 horses race against each other to be the first horse to 4 laps. The races are fast paced, often close, and have frequent lead changes. You can either follow the horses themselves or a dynamic scoreboard. I was inspired to make a horse racing game so I could experiment with different bets and payouts and automate entertaining and unpredictible races.  This is my second version of the game because I wanted to include better visuals such as animating horses and a larger racetrack. For the second version I also added sound effects such as a crowd, horse gallops, and a fast talking yet inaudible announcer.  

Every set of horses is unique, with each horse having its own autogenerated name and color. Each horse also has a probability of winning the race.  The program dictates that if the horse likely to win first place fails to place first, it will be then be the horse most likely to place second. The probability of the horses will vary but there's usually a mixture of favorites and underdogs. The race outcome is randomly selected so no two races should be exactly alike. 



For the future I want to allow the user to place different kinds of bets on the horses and get paid out accordingly. Additionally, in case you don't like a particular set of horses, I want to add a feature so a new set of horses can be summoned with the click of a button.
